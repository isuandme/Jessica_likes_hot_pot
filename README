PORT NUMBER: 2505

/****************************************************************************************/
Compile: 

Any folder: 'make' --> build, 'make clean' --> remove.


/****************************************************************************************/
Project:

This project consists of writing a C program for a remote shell system. It involves a Server and a Client process. The server process resides on another machine, in server.c, and the user provides commands to the server via a client process, in client.c, on a local machine. The client sends the commands to the server, the server executes them, and sends the output back to the client.

/****************************************************************************************/
Makefile:

The following terminal commands are supported by the local Makefile.

"make" : builds both the client and server executable files.

"make clean" : removes both client and server executable files, along with others

"make ssh" : will ssh into the Iowa State computer science pyrite server

"make scp" : will scp the current file to the directory specified

"make tar" : make a tar-ball out of the current directory

/****************************************************************************************/
Errors:
The project follows the standard errors that are produced from the standard commands. 

/****************************************************************************************/
Notes:

Each client can store it's own history and doesn't need to be sent to the server
